Description: This package is a tool to predict the power of CyTOF 
    experiments, where differential state analyses are performed. The package provides 
    a shiny app with two of checking for the power: i. generation of in-sicilico CyTOF 
    data, using users input ii. browsing in a grid of parameters where the power was 
    already precomputed.
