Description: The goal of this package is to predict the power of CyTOF 
    experiments. The package provides a way to generate in-sicilico CyTOF data
    using users input on for instance the number of markers, the number
    of cells, or the expected fold change for the differential expressed markers.
    The data are run through a GLMM model and the power is computed.
